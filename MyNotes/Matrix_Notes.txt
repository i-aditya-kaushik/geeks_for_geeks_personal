Snake Pattern:
    if row number is even:
        then we print from left to right
    else:
        reverse

Boundary Traversal:
    Print the entire first row and then the last colomn and then the last row in reverse and then the first colomn in reverse
    Handle one row and colomn explicitly

Transpose:
    Best Approach:
        Swap the upper diagonal elements with lower diagonal elements

Rotate by 90 Degree:
    Best Approach:
        Make the Transpose
        reverse colomn

Print the matrix in spiral form:
    4 variables: top, right,botton and left
    after we have traversed first row, top+=1
    when we print last colomn, right--
    when we print last row, bottom --
    when we print the first colomn, left++
    repeat this until left<=right and top<=bottom

Search row wise and colomn wise sorted matrix:
    Begin from top right colomn, if lesser, then move left until it is greater or equal.. when lesser, traverse down
