Problems with arr:
    Preallocate the space or Dynamic Size
    If Dynamic size, then it can be costly in terms of size taken
    Insertion of elements can be costly.. if need to be inserted in between
    Same for deletion
    For eg:
        Round Robin Scheduling using Arrays is very costly
    
Linked List:
    Linear Data Structure
    In c++ we use pointers and java we use refrences
    Advantages:
        We do not have to Preallocate memory.
        Insertion, deletion can be done easily
    struct Node{
        int key;
        Node *node;
        Node(int x){
            key = x;
            next = NULL;
        }
    }

    Node *insertBegin(Node *node, int key){
        Node *temp = new Node(key);
        temp->next = head;
        return *temp;
    }

    Doubly Linked List:
        c++:
            struct Node{
                int data;
                Node *next;
                Node *prev;
                Node(int d){
                    data = d;
                    next = prev = NULL;
                }
            }
        
        Python:
            class Node{
                def node(self,int data):
                    self.data = data
                    self.prev = None
                    self.next = None
            }

        Forward backward in browser are possible with doubly linked Lists

        Advantages over singly linked Lists:
            1. Can be traversed in both the directions
            2. We can delete a given node in O(1) time. It can be done with singly linked lists as well, but the last node can not be deleted with that methodology.
            3. We can insert/delete a node before a given node in O(1) time
        Disadvantages:
            1. space required for extra pointer with every node
            2. The Doubly Linked lists code becomes more comflex as extra pointer has to be maintained everywhere
    
    Circular Linked Lists:
        Advantages:
            1. We can insert at the begin and end end in O(1).
            2. traverse all nodes from any given end
            3. Best Way to implement Round Robin
        Disadvantages:
            1. Codes for traversal, insertion, deletion etc becomes slightly complex
        Types of Circular Linked Lists:
            1. singly
            2. Doubly
    Find middle of linked lists:
        Best Solution:
            Slow and Fast Nodes implementation:
                Slow moves one step at a time and fast moves 2 nodes at a time
                void printMiddle(Node *node){
                    if(head==NULL){
                        return;
                    }
                    while(fast!=NULL && fast->next!=NULL){
                        slow = slow->next;
                        fast = fast->next->next;
                    }
                    cout<<slow->data;
                }

Find nth Node from end of LL:
    Two pointer approach:
        initialize second pointer as the beginning one and first pointer as nth node from the beginning
        Traverse until the first pointer comes to the last pointer
        When it comes to the last pointer, print the data of the current node

Reverse a linked List:
    Change the links:
        next-> curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr
        curr = next
    
    Node *Reverse(Node *head){
        Node *curr = head;
        Node *prev = NULL;
        while(curr!=NULL){
            Node next = curr->next;
            curr->next= prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return(prev)
    }

    Recursive Solutions to reverse LL
        Node recRevL(Node *curr,Node *prev){
            if(curr==NULL) return prev;
            Node *next = curr->next;
            curr-> next = prev
            return recRevl(next,curr)
        }
    Reverse a LL in groups of size k
        Refer code picture: Both Recursive methodology and iterative method
    Detect Loop if there:
        Naive Solution: O(n**2)
        Option 2:
            We redefine the Node def.. we add a bool var visited
            O(n) More space tho
        Option 3:
            temp variable and make all nodes point at that node.. you destroy the LL however
        Option 4:
            Traverse the ll and put it in unordered set 
        Using Floyd Cycle Detection:
            Slow and fast nodes if equal then they have a loop... come out of the loop if any one of the node's next is NULL
    
    Detect Loop if there and then remove it:
        Use Floyd's algo
        void detectrmloop(Node *head){
            Node *slow=head, Node *fast = head;
            while(fast!=NULL and fast->next!=NULL){
                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next->next;
                if(slow==fast){
                    break;
                }
                if(slow!=fast){
                    return;
                }
                slow=head;
                while(slow->next!=fast->next){
                    slow = slow-> next;
                    fast = fast->next->next;
                }
                fast->next=NULL;
            }
        }
Without head pointer delete a given node
    Node *temp = ptr->next;
    ptr->data = temp->data;
    ptr->next = temp->next;
    delete(temp)

singly ll:
